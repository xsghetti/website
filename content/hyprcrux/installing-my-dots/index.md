<h2> This is a step by step guide on using<br> my dotfiles for Arch Linux/Hyprland</h2>

### Why *HyprCrux* you ask?
Well, to keep it as simple as possible if you're not familiar with the term...<br><br>
**Crux** <br>
*/kr…ôks/*<br>
*noun <br>
a particular point of difficulty.
plural noun: cruces; plural noun: cruxes.*

I chose this name for my [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) configuration because I have always found this realm of technology extremely difficult. As an avid rock climber, the term crux is used for the toughest move or sequence of moves on a climb. As an aspiring developer, I felt the term *Crux* fit in here as well!    

I switched to Linux full time rougly 3 months ago after tinkering for a few months on VM's and using my laptop as a test machine, and finally installing Arch Linux on my PC. I have been fascinated with [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn/) for quite some time now, and after doing very *minimal* research I saw hyprland and knew I had to get my hands on that software.
