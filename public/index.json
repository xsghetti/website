Without knowing much about IDE\u0026rsquo;s I naturally started with VSCode, as it was already preconfigured and plugins were easy to install.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not familair with Neovim, it is an extremely powerful fork of Vim aimed to simplify maintenance and encourange contributions as well as maximize the extensibility.\nTLDR: It\u0026rsquo;s a sick terminal based text editor.\nSo after playing around with this new neovim config for a bit, I knew I had to get started on my own config. There are multiple different ways to install plugins with Neovim, which made it a little challenging to figure out where I wanted to start.\nI started out with LazyVim, as I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot about it before even starting my journey with neovim. It\u0026rsquo;s a very easy install that gives you a base plugins list to immediately improve your neovim experience, including a theme.\nWhile LazyVim is great for someone just getting started with neovim, I felt it added a little too many plugins a little too quickly.\nQueue lazy.nvim # So, it took me about 6 hours of deleting my config, and restarting to realize that LazyVim and lazy.nvim were two very similar, but also two very different things. For some clarity, LazyVim is a preconfigured neovim setup utilizing the Lazy.nvim package manager.\nOnce I successfully installed lazy.nvim on a barebones neovim config, I finally felt like I was making some progress.\n","date":"6 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1712425484092-neovim/","section":"Posts","summary":"So I\u0026rsquo;ve finally been persuaded to try out NeoVim, and man am I not disapponited.","title":"Neovim?!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"6 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"6 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tag/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tag","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/arch/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Arch","type":"tags"},{"content":" This is a step by step guide on using\nmy dotfiles for Arch Linux/Hyprland xsghetti/dotfiles My current dotfiles for Arch Linux/Hyprland null 14 0 Why HyprCrux you ask? # Well, to keep it as simple as possible if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with the term\u0026hellip;\nCrux /krÉ™ks/\nnoun a particular point of difficulty. plural noun: cruces; plural noun: cruxes.\nI chose this name for my Hyprland configuration because I have always found this realm of technology extremely difficult. As an avid rock climber, the term crux is used for the toughest move or sequence of moves on a climb. As an aspiring developer, I felt the term Crux fit in here as well!\nI switched to Linux full time rougly 3 months ago after tinkering for a few months on VM\u0026rsquo;s and using my laptop as a test machine, and finally installing Arch Linux on my PC. I have been fascinated with r/unixporn for quite some time now, and after doing very minimal research I saw hyprland and knew I had to get my hands on that software.\nLets keep in mind that I\u0026rsquo;ve only messed with ubuntu probably about 10+ years ago. So jumping right into Arch \u0026amp; a Dynamic Tiling Window Manager many people would recommend against. Understandably so since there is basically no GUI involved, and its all configured editing text files. Unfortunately the animations, and window tiling had me sold immediately and there was no swaying me other wise if you catch my drift ðŸ˜‰\nTLDR: PC Aesthetic go brrrrrr\nWarning!
